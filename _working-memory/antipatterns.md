## 2026-07-23: Don't declare `hooks/hooks.json` in a plugin's `manifest.hooks`

**Tried:** `scripts/plugin-src/plugin.json` declared `"hooks": "./hooks/hooks.json"` (correct when first designed; the plan doc's "hooks have no auto-discovery" platform fact backed it).
**What broke:** The plugin installed but failed to load—current Claude Code auto-loads a plugin's `hooks/hooks.json`, so declaring that standard path is rejected as a duplicate ("manifest.hooks should only reference additional hook files"). Caught by the first live SMOKE Part C run.
**Why we backed out:** Platform behavior changed; the standard path loads on its own now. Fixed in 0.3.1 by dropping the key and rebuilding.
**Don't suggest:** adding a `hooks` key to `scripts/plugin-src/plugin.json` for the standard path, or teaching `build-plugin.py` to emit one. `manifest.hooks` is only for *additional* hook files beyond `hooks/hooks.json`.

## 2026-07-14: Don't assume parent hooks skip subagent tool calls

**Tried:** Building orchestrator-write-guard (and the docs' mental model) on "parent PreToolUse hooks don't fire for tool calls made inside a subagent."
**What broke:** On CC 2.1.x PreToolUse fires in subagents too, so the guard fired in every worker and blocked the deliverable it was dispatched to write. The guild only worked because workers silently fell back to `Bash`.
**Why we backed out:** The assumption was never true on this CC version; `agent_id` is stamped only on subagent calls (confirmed against the hooks docs).
**Don't suggest:** scoping a gate by assuming hooks won't reach subagents. Scope main-session-only gates by checking `agent_id` (`_lib.in_subagent`). See #18.

## 2026-07-14: Don't identify a subagent's task from role:user transcript messages

**Tried:** `id_from_transcript` scanned only `role:"user"` messages for a `Task-ID:` line.
**What broke:** SubagentStop hands the hook the PARENT transcript, where the dispatch is an assistant `tool_use(Task|Agent)` block, not a user message. The id was never found, the gate failed closed, and the worker hung.
**Why we backed out:** Wrong place to look; the authoritative dispatch record is the assistant tool_use.
**Don't suggest:** reading the dispatch id from user messages. Read it from the assistant `tool_use(Task|Agent)` `input.prompt` (last dispatch). See #17.
